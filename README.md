# Voicemeeter Windows Volume (AHK Version)

This is a conversion of the Voicemeeter Windows Volume app originally made in Node.js, rewritten in AutoHotkey launguage.

##### Made in Autohotkey v2.1-alpha.18


### Why use AutoHotkey v2.1 instead of AutoHotkey v2.0?  
Due to the modeless tray menu , the script continues executing even when the tray menu is open from a right-click.
